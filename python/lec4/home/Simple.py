Task 1: Write a simple Higher Order Function map(data, f), where f() is some arith function and data is a List, Dictionary and Numpy array.
map(data, f) applies function f() to every element of the data structure and returns a resulting data structure.

Can you make a single implementation, Overloaded for all those 3 data structures? Assume datatype is Int.
Which algorithmic complexity O(n) should it be? Will it depend on the underlying data structure?


Task 2: Implement a speed optimized function for Task 1, the fastest you can. What algorithmic complexity O(n) should it be ?
