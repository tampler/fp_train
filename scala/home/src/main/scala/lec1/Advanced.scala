  def Sum (vec:Vector[Int]):Int = ???

  // Task 1

  // Implement a function, which sums all elevements in the int vector in several different ways 

  // With a lib function 
  // Using vars
  // using immutables only
  // using for iteration 
  // using recursion
  // your own idea

  // Task 2 

  // For recursive Implementation, can you implement a function, which sums up very large vectors? What are potential dangers for a recursive implementation?
